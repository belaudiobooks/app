# Mobile application audiobooks.by

At this stage we assume application will represent highly available catalog with content from https://audiobooks.by/ for Android and iOS platforms.

Application going to be implemented on [Kotlin Multiplatform Platform (KMP)](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/) with separate UI part for each platform ([SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) for iOS and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) for Android).

In case you are new in KMP it is highly recommended to pass this two tutorials: 
* [Get started with Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-getting-started.html)
* [Create a multiplatform app using Ktor and SQLDelight](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-ktor-sqldelight.html)
